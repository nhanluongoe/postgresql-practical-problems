-- How can you produce a list of facilities, with each labelled as 'cheap' or 'expensive' depending on if their monthly maintenance cost is more than $100? Return the name and monthly maintenance of the facilities in question.
SELECT name,
  CASE
    WHEN monthlymaintenance > 100 THEN 'expensive'
    ELSE 'cheap'
  END AS cost
FROM cd.facilities;
